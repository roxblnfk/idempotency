/**
 * Data-only config for an AtMostOnce dedup-guard over a Cycle DBAL connection.
 *
 * The dedup marker commits before the effect and is never removed, so the effect runs at most once and
 * a duplicate is *refused* rather than re-run (a repeat is therefore NOT safe to retry). This guards
 * the effect (≤ 1) but does not cache the answer by default: a duplicate gets `null`.
 *
 * Set {@see $cacheResult} to also store and replay the operation result — best-effort only: the marker
 * and the result are not committed atomically, so a crash between them loses the cache (not the dedup).
 * Atomic marker + result is the upgrade to {@see \Spiral\Idempotency\Driver\Cycle\CycleInboxConfig}.
 *
 * Security: with {@see $cacheResult} on, results are (de)serialized by the storage's
 * {@see \Spiral\Serializer\SerializerInterface}; the default {@see \Spiral\Serializer\Serializer\PhpSerializer}
 * restores them via `unserialize()` on replay, so the table is the trust boundary — bind a JSON
 * serializer if several services or roles write into it.
