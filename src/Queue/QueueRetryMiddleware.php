/**
 * Queue outcome middleware: maps the idempotent call's failure modes back to the transport. The queue
 * analog of {@see \Spiral\Idempotency\Http\HttpOutcomeMiddleware}, but jobs return void, so there is NO
 * response marshalling — only failure mapping.
 *
 *  - turns a {@see LockedException} (someone else holds PROCESSING for this key) into a
 *    {@see RetryableLockException}, so the job is re-enqueued after the lock TTL rather than failing;
 *  - lets a {@see \Spiral\Idempotency\Exception\MissingKeyException} propagate untouched: a job that can
 *    never resolve a key is not retryable and should dead-letter instead of retrying forever;
 *  - passes the handler's return value through untouched — including a `null` from an AtMostOnce
 *    duplicate — so the consumer ACKs the job (fire-once semantics).
 *
 * ORDERING: Spiral's default-on `Spiral\Queue\Interceptor\Consume\RetryPolicyInterceptor` must sit
 * OUTSIDE this interceptor in the `interceptors.consume` list, so it catches the re-thrown
 * {@see RetryableLockException}, resolves its {@see RetryableLockException::getRetryPolicy()} and
 * re-queues the job with the carried delay. We do not reimplement any of that machinery here.
